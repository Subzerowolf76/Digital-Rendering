# Digital-Rendering
Developed a C++ Digital Rendering project using OpenGL, rendering both 2D and 3D objects. Demonstrated techniques include texture mapping, camera manipulation, and lighting effects, along with implementing physics-based collision systems. 

Currently having trouble uploading this project to GitHub, will update soon.
